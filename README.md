## Deployment

Validate that the code is Production ready. Run the below:
```bash
npm run build
```

If this doesn't throw any errors, go ahead and publish to the `preview` branch to automatically update the Pre-Production domain in **Vercel**.

Once validating everything in Pre-Production, create a pull request to merge the changes from `preview` into `main`. This will automatically update the Production domain in **Vercel**.
